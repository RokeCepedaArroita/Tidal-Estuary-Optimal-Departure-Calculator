TIDE AMPLITUDE: 2.1 m (from max to min)

RIVER SPEED:
-02 min: 0.86 ± 0.21 km/h  (bend after dam) -- -0.03 tide, 0.89 river, +0.6 km
+08 min: 1.04 ± 0.07 km/h  (after dam)      -- +0.11 tide, 0.93 river, +0.1 km

INTERMEDIATE POINTS:
+28 min: 0.81 ± 0.11 km/h  (after bend after dam) -- 0.38 tide, 0.43 river, +0.8 km
+54 min: 1.37 ± 0.05 km/h  (club abanico)         -- 0.73 tide, 0.64 river, +3.0 km

TIDE SPEED:
+1h 52 min: 1.35 ± 0.04 km/h  (exit)
→ 79.19% maximum tide speed, therefore max tide speed = 1.70*(tide_amplitude/2.1) km/h
(worst possible tidal current around 3.5 km/h)

AVERAGE KAYAK SPEED OVER WATER: 4.9 km/h


RIVER MODEL:
f(x) = p1*x + p2, where x is distance in km and y is speed in km/h
p1 =    -0.07155  (-0.372, 0.2289)
p2 =      0.8381  (0.1553, 1.521)

0.838 km/h at dam, 0.287 km/h at end

Or if forced to 0 at the end (not true), we get 0.91 at dam, reducing to 0 at the end
